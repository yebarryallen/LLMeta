Abstract

This study aimed to examine the degree of homogeneity versus heterogeneity of individuals’ political information environments across offline and online media types and relations with sociodemographic variables, personality, and political attitudes. In two online surveys, German participants (sample 1: N = 686; sample 2: N = 702) provided information on sociodemographic variables, consumption of political news, and voting intentions, and completed the Big Five Inventory and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) scales. Results revealed that absolutely homogeneous political news consumption was evident for a small proportion of individuals (2.04% and 0.43%). Openness (positively) and Agreeableness (negatively) exhibited significant associations with the degree of heterogeneity of political information environments across samples. No consistent patterns of relations with either the ideological attitudes of RWA and SDO or voting intentions were observed. The findings shed light on the existence of absolutely homogeneous political information environments and “who” might be prone to a more homogeneous versus more heterogeneous information environment.

Introduction

So-called filter bubbles and echo chambers generate much discussion in the mass media and scientific literature.
page2:Within the past six months prior to participation, and on how often one was confronted with counter-attitudinal news, might be (un-)consciously biased. Nevertheless, the application of self-report measures allowed us to assess the degree of heterogeneity across various offline and online media types, which is very difficult to assess via objective methods. The HoHe score and its constituent items might be improved in future work, for example, by adding variables on the frequency of use, or the time spent on each media type. Another potential limitation is that across all results effect sizes were mostly small to medium, according to Cohen’s (1992) rules of thumb. This indicates that the degree of heterogeneity of one’s political news consumption, as well as voting intentions for a specific party, are complex psychological constructs and many different variables and their interactions contribute to explaining variance in them, with each single variable only having a small effect (Götz et al., 2021).

Conclusion

In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that absolutely homogeneous political information environments across various media types might exist for a small proportion of individuals. Next to age and gender, the personality traits Openness (positively) and Agreeableness (negatively) seem to be associated with the degree of heterogeneity of an individual’s political information environment, especially for online media types (see Supplementary Material). This knowledge can support targeting certain groups for information campaigns in the future. In particular, individuals high in Agreeableness and low in Openness might profit from being informed about highly homogeneous political information environments and putative threats arising from them. Finally, no definite conclusion about associations between the degree of heterogeneity of an individual’s political information environments and voting intentions can be drawn from the present findings. Future studies should investigate other measures of political attitudes to shed further light on putative associations. In addition, longitudinal studies would be of great importance in investigating potential causal effects in these associations.

n = 114) as their highest educational degree. There were participants from each federal state in Germany in this sample.

A descriptive comparison of the two samples with German census data in relation to some key variables is presented in the Supplementary Material. None of the samples is completely representative of the general German population.

Measures

The same measures were used in both surveys to recruit sample 1 and sample 2. Details on internal consistencies are presented in the Supplementary Material.

Personality. The Big Five personality traits were assessed by using the German version of the Big Five Inventory (BFI) (John et al., 1991; Rammstedt and Danner, 2017). This questionnaire consists of 44 items. Actually, the German version of the BFI comprises an additional 45th item. This item, however, was not considered in the present analyses for closer comparability with studies applying the questionnaire in other languages. Each item was answered on a 5-point rating scale ranging from 1 = “very inapplicable” to 5 = “very applicable.”

Ideological attitudes. RWA was assessed using the Short Scale on Authoritarianism (KSA-3; abbreviation based on the German name of the scale) (Beierlein et al., 2014). The scale consists of nine items answered on a 5-point rating scale ranging from 1 = “strongly disagree” to 5 = “strongly agree.” SDO was assessed by applying a German version (Six, Wolfradt and Zick, 2001, as cited in Mortal, 2011 and revised by Sindermann et al., 2021) of the Social Dominance Orientation scale by Pratto et al. (1994). The questionnaire consists of 16 items, answered on a 7-point rating scale ranging from 1 = “very negative” to 7 = “very positive.”

Current voting intentions. Voting intentions were assessed using one question asking participants which party they would vote for if general German elections were held the following Sunday. Response options were: DIE LINKE, SPD, Bündnis 90/Die Grünen, FDP, CDU/CSU, AfD (parties ordered from left to right according to Volkens et al. (2020); the first three are left-of-center and the latter three are right-of-center parties), others, and “I would not vote.”

Degree of homogeneity versus heterogeneity of political news consumption. A detailed description of the theoretical underpinnings of the measure assessing the degree of (homogeneity versus) heterogeneity of political news consumption is presented in the Supplementary Material. The following items assessing the participants’ news consumption were used:

1.
Participants were initially asked whether they used each of the following eight media types to become informed about political news (1 = “yes,” 0 = “no”): (1) TV, (2) print media, (3) radio, (4) online news websites, (5) smartphone news applications, (6) news aggregators, (7) podcasts, and (8) news feeds of social media platforms.

political attitudes. Accordingly, findings on whether or not a lower degree of heterogeneity of one’s (political) information environment more broadly (not focusing specifically on social media) is associated with polarization and/or more extreme political attitudes remain inconclusive. It clearly seems important then to investigate the degree of heterogeneity of political information environments and associations with political attitudes across different news sources. In a related area, a study from Germany found that a group of individuals who stated they would not vote if general elections were held the following Sunday showed the lowest number of different news sources consumed across offline and online media types. This group was closely followed by the groups of individuals who had the intention of voting for the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which represents a populist right-wing party (Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung, 2017; Schleunes et al., 2020; Volkens et al., 2020) or for “other” smaller parties (Sindermann et al., 2020). Potential voters of DIE LINKE (the left-wing German party), which can be deemed the most extreme left of the major German parties (Volkens et al., 2020), reported the highest number of different news sources consumed (Sindermann et al., 2020). This indicates that the lowest heterogeneity of political information environments is linked to individuals intending to abstain from voting, or to vote for the AfD or for “other” smaller parties; although it must be noted that the sample of the previous study was not representative of the general German population and that heterogeneity in news consumption was not directly assessed.

Summary and aims of the present study

In summary, there is an ongoing discussion on whether and to what extent homogeneous information environments exist. The present study aimed to contribute to this discussion by providing empirical data on the information environments of individuals in relation to political news by applying a dimensional approach. In comparison to many previous studies, we took into account various online and offline media types. The present study also aimed to examine individual differences in sociodemographic variables and personality in association with the degree of heterogeneity of one’s political information environment. We expected age (positively), gender (higher in men), educational level (positively), and Openness (positively) to be associated with a higher degree of heterogeneity of one’s political information environment. Finally, we aimed to investigate associations between the degree of heterogeneity of political information environments with ideological and political attitudes. RWA and SDO were expected to be negatively associated with the degree of heterogeneity of one’s political information environment. We also expected lower heterogeneity of political information environments for the groups of individuals indicating they would not vote, vote for the AfD, or for “other” smaller parties.
