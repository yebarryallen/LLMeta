}","Fueling civil disobedience in democracy: WhatsApp news use, political knowledge, and illegal political protest","Prior scholarship has consistently shown that informed citizens tend to better understand government actions, expectations, and priorities, potentially mitigating radicalism such as partaking in illegal protest. However, the role of social media may prove this relationship to be challenging, with an increasingly pervasive use of applications such as WhatsApp for information and mobilization. Findings from a two-wave US panel survey data show that WhatsApp news is negatively associated to political knowledge and positively associated to illegal protest. Less politically knowledgeable citizens also tend to engage in illegal protest more frequently. Results also suggest an influential role of political knowledge in mediating the effects of WhatsApp news over illegal protests. Those who consume more news on WhatsApp tend to know less about politics which, in turn, positively relates to unlawful political protest activities. This study suggests that WhatsApp affordances provide fertile paths to nurture illegal political protest participation.",True,5UHCTHGK,"Prior scholarship has consistently shown that informed citizens tend to better understand government actions, expectations, and priorities, potentially mitigating radicalism such as partaking in illegal protest.

}",Political Participation of Young Voters: Tracing Direct and Indirect Effects of Social Media and Political Orientations,"Political participation in Pakistan was expected to rise because of the enormous democratic potential of social media; nevertheless, a drop has been observed following an initial increase. This scenario encourages investigation of the decisive factors that might draw disengaged citizens into participatory politics. Therefore, this study illustrates the results of a Pakistani sample (n = 410) regarding the role of social media in influencing political participation in online and offline platforms. Five variables were examined using partial least squares (PLS) to see how they influenced online and offline political participation. The OSOR model of communication mediation was used for this purpose. Its implications were extended by simultaneously incorporating three outcome orientations-political expression, political efficacy, and partisanship-as mediators. In addition, we included political interest as an antecedent orientation and social media use as stimuli. Online and offline political participation were placed under response as endogenous variables. Our findings acknowledged nine direct and five indirect correlations out of ten direct and six indirect relationships. Political efficacy neither influenced offline political participation nor proved to be a mediator between social media use and offline political participation. We conclude with study implications, limitations, and recommendations for future scholars.",True,CVL74JL4,"Political participation in Pakistan was expected to rise because of the enormous democratic potential of social media; nevertheless, a drop has been observed following an initial increase.

}",The mobilizing effects of political media consumption among external voters,"This study examines political media consumption among non-resident citizens, and whether following politics in traditional and social media in their country of residence and origin has a mobilizing effect on voting in origin-country elections. The topic of our study is inspired by the trend towards increased enfranchisement of external citizens, improved methods for participation from abroad, and the transformation of the media landscape with enhanced possibilities for external voters to follow politics in their country of origin. Based on a survey directed towards a stratified random sample of Finnish external citizens in 15 countries, we find that politically oriented media consumption in the country of origin substantially increases the likelihood of participating in origin-country elections and that this effect holds for traditional media channels as well as for social media. A corresponding mobilizing effect is, however, not found for following politics in the country of residence. This demonstrates the value of relevant information for political participation.",True,3MH4DCKH,"This study examines political media consumption among non-resident citizens, and whether following politics in traditional and social media in their country of residence and origin has a mobilizing effect on voting in origin-country elections.

This ""viral"" spread of fake news created an ""infodemic"" that threatened the compliance with public health guidelines and recommendations. Objective This study aims to describe the trust in social media platforms and the exposure to fake news about COVID-19 in Lebanon and to explore their association with vaccination intent. Methods In this cross-sectional study conducted in Lebanon during July-August, 2020, a random sample of 1052 participants selected from a mobile-phone database responded to an anonymous structured questionnaire after obtaining informed consent (response rate = 40%). The questionnaire was conducted by telephone and measured socio-demographics, sources and trust in sources of information and exposure to fake news, social media activity, perceived threat and vaccination intent. Results Results indicated that the majority of participants (82%) believed that COVID-19 is a threat and 52% had intention to vaccinate. Exposure to fake/ unverified news was high (19.7% were often and 63.8% were sometimes exposed, mainly to fake news shared through Watsapp and Facebook). Trust in certain information sources (WHO, MoPH and TV) increased while trust in others (Watsapp, Facebook) reduced vaccination intent against Covid-19. Believing in the man-made theory and the business control theory significantly reduced the likelihood of vaccination intent (Beta = 0.43; p = 0.01 and Beta = -0.29; p = 0.05) respectively. Conclusion In the context of the infodemic, understanding the role of exposure to fake news and of conspiracy believes in shaping healthy behavior is important for increasing vaccination intent and planning adequate response to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.",True,AS4VJSV3,"Background The massive, free and unrestricted exchange of information on the social media during the Covid-19 pandemic has set fertile grounds for fear, uncertainty and the rise of fake news related to the virus.

We argue that users' perceptions of platform affordances influence both (a) their self-participation in uncivil political discussion on social media and (b) perceptions of others' engagement, which eventually shape their perceptions of polarization. Our analysis of US survey data found that perceptions of lower privacy and stronger network association on Facebook are related to perceptions of a higher level of uncivil discussion by other users, which in turn predicts greater perceived polarization. Perceptions of higher anonymity relate to higher self-participation in uncivil discussion, which is surprisingly associated with perceptions of reduced polarization. Our follow-up experimental study illustrated that participants with more frequent engagement in uncivil discussion, irrespective of interacting with civil or uncivil comments, showed consistently higher levels of intrapersonal reflection, which reduces perceived polarization.",True,U8YCHZNB,"This research applies a perceived affordance approach to examine the distinctive role of social media technologies in shaping (mis)perceptions of political polarization.

However, this evidence comes overwhelmingly from frequent internet users in rich, Western countries. We run a panel survey early in the pandemic leveraging a prepandemic sample of urban middle-class Nigerians, many of whom do not use the internet. Analysis shows that opposition party support and social media usage are correlated with belief in antigovernment misinformation but not other types of COVID-19 misinformation. Surprisingly, we find no relationship between overall belief in misinformation and willingness to be vaccinated several weeks later. Partisanship and ethnicity are predictive of vaccine hesitancy, while men are both more likely to believe misinformation and more willing to be vaccinated.

}",Political Communication Patterns of Young Adults in Germany,"While the political communication and participation activities of young adults are changing, this is often not adequately captured by research due to a too narrow conceptualization of the phenomenon. Our approach conceptualizes political communication as activities comprising the reception of political content, interpersonal communication regarding political issues and political participation. We incorporated both analog and digital media, as well as different forms of political participation, to reflect the complex reality of political communication activities of young adults in the digital age. On the basis of a sample from 2013, we investigated the patterns of political communication of young adults (ages 18-33 years). This age group represents the first generation to have grown up under the ubiquitous influence of the internet and other modern information technologies. In addition, we examined factors influencing the formation of different political communication patterns of this generation. Results of cluster analyses demonstrated that young adults should not be seen as a homogeneous group. Rather, we found six communication types. Interestingly, no online-only type of political communication was revealed, By applying multinomial logistic regression analysis, we were able to demonstrate that socio-demographic variables, individual resources and cognitive involvement in politics influence the likelihood of belonging to more active political communication types. The present study investigated various information and communication opportunities of young adults, and is rare in terms of the richness of data provided. Our conceptual innovative approach enables a better understanding of young adults' complex political communication patterns. Moreover, our approach encourages follow-up research, as our results provide a valuable starting point for intergenerational comparisons regarding changes in political engagement among young adults in Germany, as well as for cross-country analysis regarding different generations of young adults.",True,JAXEWW3V,"While the political communication and participation activities of young adults are changing, this is often not adequately captured by research due to a too narrow conceptualization of the phenomenon.

We theorize that the threat of exclusionary policies creates and resurfaces grievances that facilitate mobilization. To test our theory, we leverage Donald Trump's announcement of a peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which posed a threat to the citizenship status of Palestinian citizens of Israel residing in the Triangle area adjacent to the West Bank. First, using more than 170,000 posts from public Facebook groups and pages, we show that Trump's announcement was indeed a more salient political event for Triangle residents. Then, employing locality-level election data as well as records detailing the origin of citizens' joining a Jewish-Arab social movement, we use a difference-in-difference design to demonstrate that the threat to citizenship imposed by Trump's plan increased mobilization in the Triangle area.

}",Profiles of News Consumption in a High-Choice Media Environment: Evidence from Romania,"During the last two decades, media and information environments have changed in a fundamental way. Generalized low levels of trust in media sources, incidental news exposure, and higher probability to be exposed only to views similar to their own and echo chambers are just some of the most important challenges within the current, high-choice media landscape. All of them have major ramifications for the information environment as a whole and, particularly, for the way in which they could influence people in becoming informed citizens. In this paper, we explore how news consumption patterns of mainstream and social media are associated with trust in media sources and other news consumption related phenomena, such as incidental news exposure and echo chambers. Theoretically, this study starts from the idea that today, within the current media environment, people tend to consume cross-media information(1). In other terms, people's news media diet consists of different media sources and media content(2). Some recent research studies investigating people's media diets put forward ""profiles"" showing how people consume media content, in an attempt to find out patterns of news consumption and how they might affect various democracy related aspects.(3) Drawing on a news repertoires approach, the presented study aims at investigating news media consumption patterns among Romanian people. By means of a national survey (N=1,000), this study explores the main characteristics of news media consumers in Romania, in an attempt to shed more light on people's media diets (what they actually consume) within the current, high-choice media landscape. The main findings from our study reveal that minimalist news users are the most prevalent category among the investigated sample. Compared with all the other types of news users, minimalist news users have the lowest levels of trust in both mainstream and social media sources. At the same time, they are less prone to be accidentally exposed to news stories, but more prone to be stuck in echo chambers, in environments where they encounter information that reflects or reinforces their own views. From a socio-demographic point of view, all types of consumers share more or less the same characteristics, with an age-related significant difference. These results offer important insights into the way in which news consumption patterns are associated with certain perceptions and attitudes that might result in letting citizens be less informed or even uninformed.

Following a presidential campaign based on misinformation and accusations of electoral fraud by Republican candidate Donald Trump, the level of maximum polarization causes a climate of social rupture. Faced with this, the Democratic candidate and winner of the elections, Joe Biden, projects a discourse of institutional stability and legality as a strategy before public opinion. Two years later, the abrupt division of the US electorate is evident, with a significant percentage of Republican voters questioning the legitimacy of the electoral process.

The engagement value of the social audience on Twitter is also added, with a position of support for the winner of the elections."

This user engagement, in turn, is associated with political behavior, such as voting. Nonetheless, few studies so far have investigated the interaction between these factors. We examine how anti-immigration attitudes are associated with user engagement with political parties on social media. In this study, user engagement is understood as following political parties on social media. Through online data that were collected in October 2019 among adults (N= 1,000) in Belgium, we investigate how attitudes and user engagement are associated with voting behavior. Results suggest that attitudes towards migration are associated with user engagement with both left and right-wing parties on social media. Moreover, these attitudes and user engagement - and the interaction between the two - are related to voting behavior: being against (being in favor of) migration and following right-wing (left-wing) parties on social media is associated with a higher likelihood of voting for a right-wing (left-wing) party. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",True,VFNUUK97,"Societally salient issues, like migration, stimulate user engagement with political parties on social media.

Longitudinal upstream and downstream effects of political participation,"Digitally networked and new, unconventional activities allow citizens to participate politically in activities that are low in the effort and risks they bear. At the same time, low-effort types of participation are more loosely connected to democratic political systems, thereby challenging established modes of political decision-making. This can set in motion two competing dynamics: While some citizens move closer to the political system in their activities (upstream effects), others engage in political activities more distant from it (downstream effects). This study investigates non-electoral participation trajectories and tests intra-individual change in political participation types over time, exploring whether such dynamics depend on citizens' exposure to political information.

It shows that the ""individual involvement-entertainment-oriented"" mode of internet use does not have a negative impact on the conventional and unconventional political participation of Chinese urban internet users. Similarly, the ""group involvement-entertainment-oriented"" mode of internet use has no significant effect on unconventional political participation. Taken together, the study shows that, in general, internet use has promoted the political participation of Chinese urban netizens, but there are significant differences between the different modes of internet use. As a revolutionary medium, the internet not only provides people with a convenient way of obtaining and communicating information, but also creates more challenges for state governance. The way in which the government should deal with different forms of political participation in the internet age will be an important research topic in the future."

Using a communication mediation framework, this research investigates the underlying mechanisms of how exposure to COVID-19 information on social media affects the willingness to conduct COVID-19 preventive measures in South Korea. A structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis of survey data from 1,209 Korean adults showed that social media exposure indirectly influenced the intention to take preventive actions through interpersonal communication, social media expression and knowledge. The findings also revealed that social media exposure exerted differential effects on the intention to adopt preventive measures depending on the types of reasoning, including interpersonal communication and social media expression.

A mixed-method approach, combining Facebook browser tracking data and a four-wave panel survey, was adopted during the 2021 Dutch General Election campaign. The results showed that the number of political ads received from a specific party has a positive effect on both the propensity and choice to vote for that party. In addition, people with less political knowledge and online privacy literacy are more likely to be persuaded by online political ads. However, at the party level, there is no evidence indicating that the effect of political ads on party preference is stronger for new parties than for established parties.

However, the social media scenario is constantly changing and new platforms frequently appear.

Thus, due to its popularization and the fact that politicians and election candidates have begun to use it, there is a strong need to understand its use and impacts. Within this context, the present study aims to analyze how the main candidates running in the 2022 Brazilian presidential election used their official profiles, how citizens engaged with the candidates' posts, and the possible correlations between a candidate's performance and the votes received. For this, we collected and analyzed all the posts shared by candidates between June and October 30, 2022, the day of the second round. As a result, 576 posts and more than 540 million interactions were analyzed, and our findings show that: (i) candidates used TikTok in a similar manner to how they used Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in the 2018 elections; (ii) strong differences were observed regarding the quality and content of posts made by the observed candidates; (iii) despite having fewer followers, the elected president received 55% of the total interactions; and (iv) for the first round, the share of the number of likes received by the elected candidate was exactly the vote share received in the elections, although this was not repeated in the second round.

Using data collected in the period immediately prior to the start of this social unrest, this study seeks to establish the role played by strong-tied social media-which are generally homogeneous, formed by close people, and with a high potential for influencing their members-in three phenomena associated with political conflict: (a) perceived political polarization, (b) affective polarization, and (c) non-conventional political participation. To estimate this influence, information collected through surveys in Chile in 2017 and Colombia in 2018 was used within the framework of the Comparative National Elections project. In both countries, probabilistic samples were employed to do face-to-face interviews with samples of over 1,100 people. In both countries, the results show that the use of social media with strong ties, specifically WhatsApp, tends to be related to two of the studied phenomena: perceived political polarization and non-conventional participation. An interaction is also observed between WhatsApp use and political ideology that amplifies the degree of perceived political polarization, affective polarization, and participation in one or both of the countries studied. We conclude by arguing that this dual phenomenon of polarization and participation can be problematic for democracy, since polarized groups (or groups that have the perception that there is ideological polarization in the political elite) tend to consider the position of the rest of the citizens to be illegitimate, thus undermining collective problem-solving.",True,NAGACNHZ,"Chile and Colombia are two South American countries with political and economic similarities that, during 2019, faced strong social outbursts, which translated into massive street protests and the weakening of their governments.

Objectives: This study aimed to discuss how social media is being used to spread fake news during the COVID-19 pandemic and the reasons behind this. In addition, this paper examines the overall use of social media by university students and their role in sharing fake news on social media. Methodology: An online survey was used to collect data from students who had a minimum of one social media account. Facebook groups, messengers and emails were used for data collection and 264 responses were recorded. Findings: This study found that 92.8% of students received COVID-19-related news on social media, 61% experienced fake news in many cases. This is because most users of social media share news without checking its authenticity and reliability, and without checking facts against reliable sources. It was also found that most students were fairly confident in detecting fake news and checked the authenticity of the news before sharing it on social media. Originality/Value: This is the initial effort in Bangladesh to recognise the role of social media in propagating false news during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the sample size of this study was very small. Further studies with larger sample sizes may reveal a more evident understanding of this topic.",True,D3HVQVCV,"Context: After its emergence in China in 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Bangladesh on March 8, 2020.

The rapidly growing influence of social media prompted this exploratory research article on the use of social networking sites by politicians to build a cordial and strong relationship with the common citizens. This article focuses on investigating social media's influence on the relationship between politicians and citizens through the moderating effect of political slogans. Social media not only enables the politicians to directly communicate with the citizens but also encourages political participation of citizens in the form of feedback via comments on social networking sites. Political slogans play a significant role in the image building of a particular political force in the eyes of citizens. A quantitative analysis approach is utilized in this study. Data are collected via a survey questionnaire from a variety of social media users with a cross-sectional time horizon. In total, 300 people submitted their responses via the questionnaire, which was circulated in the first 2 months of this year (i.e., January and February 2022). The convenience sampling method was utilized for data collection across two cities in Pakistan. Smart PLS 3 has been used for hypothesis testing. The effect of the Moderator, i.e., political slogans of the basic four political parties of Pakistan are measured individually.

To reach this aim, the needed data were collected through qualitative and quantitative approaches. A total of 303 valid questionnaires were analyzed. The sample consisted of university Turkish students across undergraduate, masters, and PhD levels in Turkiye aged between 18 and 50+. As well, an online focus group discussion with six Turkish students from different universities and education levels was conducted to gain a more in-depth understanding of the study's problem. The results of the study showed that the perspectives of the Turkish students were that social media had a weak-to-moderate effect on political polarization in Turkiye. Furthermore, the results indicated that the studied sample of the Turkish students does not rely on social media platforms to obtain political news, and most of them do not follow political leaders on social media. Moreover, communication platforms did not encourage many Turkish students to express themselves, which is an indication that social media algorithms have contributed to a medium degree in creating filter bubbles through the content they suggest to users.

There is also a limited understanding of the factors that influence the mobilizing or reinforcing role of incidental news exposure in this process. This study examines the role of incidental news exposure on social media in political interest-driven participatory gaps in Singapore. It also examines how education, social network size, and heterogeneous political discussions further modify the effect of incidental news on the participatory gaps between high and low political interest groups. Findings from primary survey data support the reinforcement thesis, suggesting that politically disinterested individuals are negatively affected by frequent incidental news exposure, but those with high political interest benefit. Moderated moderation analyses indicate that these participatory gaps only exist at higher education levels and within more extensive social networks. Further, politically disinterested citizens are at risk for further disengagement if they encounter news accidentally in bigger social networks or engage in heterogeneous political discussion.

These insights underscore the growing urgency to address online hate speech, especially as online activity continue to intensify. This study contributes to the discourse on online hate speech regulation by highlighting the complex interplay of personal experience, perceived harm, and efficacy of regulation in shaping public consensus."

We evaluated digital media literacy interventions to improve misinformation resilience among four communities of color in the United States (Black, Latino, Asian American/Pacific Islander, Native American), which were designed by the nonprofit PEN America and community partner organizations. We assessed intervention efficacy in two studies: (1) a quasi-experimental field study among diverse participants recruited via community outreach and (2) a randomized controlled trial among Latinos recruited via a survey company (total N = 370). Results indicated that participants in both studies improved their comprehension of digital media literacy skills after taking the intervention.

Objective: This study aims to assess the associations between social media use patterns; demographics; and knowledge, perceptions, and self-reported adherence toward COVID-19 prevention guidelines, due to growing and evolving social media use. Methods: Quota-sampled data were collected through a web-based survey of US adults through the Qualtrics platform, from March 15, 2022, to March 23, 2022, to assess covariates (eg, demographics, vaccination, and political affiliation), frequency of social media use, social media sources of COVID-19 information, as well as knowledge, perceptions, and self-reported adherence toward COVID-19 prevention guidelines. Three linear regression models were used for data analysis. Results: A total of 1043 participants responded to the survey, with an average age of 45.3 years, among which 49.61% (n=515) of participants were men, 66.79% (n=696) were White, 11.61% (n=121) were Black or African American, 13.15% (n=137) were Hispanic or Latino, 37.71% (n=382) were Democrat, 30.21% (n=306) were Republican, and 25% (n=260) were not vaccinated.

Using original two-wave panel survey data (N = 679), this study reveals that social media interaction increases misperception directly, as well as indirectly by reducing the extent of risk perception. The extent of risk perception is found to be a negative predictor of misperception. The deleterious role of social media interaction on misperception is pronounced across groups of conservatives and liberals, but in different ways. Although the effects of social media interaction on the level of misperception are observed in both conservatives and liberals, this relationship is particularly salient among conservatives. Furthermore, whereas conservatives consistently show low levels of risk perception toward COVID-19 regardless of how much they interact with others on social media, the more liberals interact on social media, the less likely they are to perceive COVID-19-related risks.

The deleterious role of social media interaction on misperception is pronounced across groups of conservatives and liberals, but in different ways. Although the effects of social media interaction on the level of misperception are observed in both conservatives and liberals, this relationship is particularly salient among conservatives. Furthermore, whereas conservatives consistently show low levels of risk perception toward COVID-19 regardless of how much they interact with others on social media, the more liberals interact on social media, the less likely they are to perceive COVID-19-related risks. The findings expand our understanding of the role of interaction behaviors on social media in forming risk perceptions and misperceptions on the politicized COVID-19 pandemic."

The resulting echo chamber effect can reinforce existing views and discourage rational discussion. We conducted a survey with a representative sample of 1969 respondents in 2020. Contrary to common expectation, a liberal political orientation was insignificant in predicting reference to differing views, but political partisanship, media trust, time spent on social media, education levels, and gender were significant. Those who spent more time on social media and had lower trust in media were found to refer to other views more frequently and were less susceptible to the echo chamber effect.

Findings showed that three communication channels (i.e., news involvement, on-line political expression, and off-line political discussion) mediate the positive relationship between political interest and participation through different paths. When people are more interested in politics, they will be more likely to read political news, leading to more on-line political expression, which then motivates higher level of political participation. In parallel, political interest could also increase political participation first through news involvement and then through off-line political discussion. More importantly, compared with the total indirect effects on participation in electoral campaigns, political interest could exert stronger indirect effect on participation in political advocacy through the three communication channels under study. In addition, the mediating effect of on-line political expression is more powerful than off-line political discussion in mobilizing participation in political advocacy.

The results showed that voters perceive online political ads that are about a topic that they care about as more interesting, informative, and persuasive regardless of their partisanship. This positive ad perception subsequently leads to a higher probability of voting for the promoted party in the ad.

Affective and argumentative engagement on Twitter, following the Christchurch terrorist attack","This article intervenes in debates about whether public-facing social media enable the rapid spread of hate speech, or whether these platforms can offer valuable opportunities to contest it. Advancing scholarship on 'networked counter-publics' and research emphasising the affective dimensions of digital media, we identify three different modes of counter-public contestation that coalesced on Twitter in the immediate aftermath of the Christchurch terrorist attack. Using a combined keyword and hashtag search, our research project sampled 3,099,138 tweets posted on/about the Christchurch attack and its repercussions, between 15 March 2019 and 15 April 2019. First, we examine two hashtags that trended, approaching these as nodal points for the construction of different affective responses to the terrorist attack. Second, we analyse instances where users quote-tweeted the condolences of politicians, rejecting their sentiments, arguing that the sincerity conditions of the Speech Act (condolence) were not met.

Advancing scholarship on 'networked counter-publics' and research emphasising the affective dimensions of digital media, we identify three different modes of counter-public contestation that coalesced on Twitter in the immediate aftermath of the Christchurch terrorist attack. Using a combined keyword and hashtag search, our research project sampled 3,099,138 tweets posted on/about the Christchurch attack and its repercussions, between 15 March 2019 and 15 April 2019. First, we examine two hashtags that trended, approaching these as nodal points for the construction of different affective responses to the terrorist attack. Second, we analyse instances where users quote-tweeted the condolences of politicians, rejecting their sentiments, arguing that the sincerity conditions of the Speech Act (condolence) were not met.

Examining the Contextual Roles of Issue and Affective Polarization in Developed Democracies,"Studies addressing the normative questions of whether social media use positively or negatively affects citizens' levels of democratic engagement and satisfaction with democracy have produced mixed findings. This study tests the proposition that political polarization plays an important contingent role in explaining these relationships. Combining Varieties of Democracy (VDEM) and World Values Survey (WVS) data, this study examines how issue polarization and affective polarization at the country level shape the relationships between social media use for political information and democratic outcomes in 27 developed democracies. The findings show divergent consequences of social media use contingent on affective polarization. In the countries with high affective polarization, social media use increased democratic engagement (i.e. participation and voting) and decreased satisfaction with democracy (i.e. political satisfaction and perceived quality of democracy), which may have implications for democratic erosion and backsliding. In the countries with low affective polarization, social media use increased the perceived quality of democracy but had no effect on political satisfaction. Issue polarization had a limited contingent influence. The findings contribute to the literature by explicating the dynamics of country-level affective polarization that can shape and contextualize the relationship between social media use and democratic engagement in democracies across the world.",True,IXUUY5H3,"Studies addressing the normative questions of whether social media use positively or negatively affects citizens' levels of democratic engagement and satisfaction with democracy have produced mixed findings.

We combine panel surveys taken before and during the first nation-wide lockdown with webtracking data of participants' online behaviour to paint a nuanced picture of media effects during the crisis. Our work has several findings. First, political trust, an attitude known for its stability, increased following lockdown. Second, consumption of mainstream news on COVID-19 directly hindered this increase, with those reading more news having lower over-time trust, while the relatively minor alternative news consumption had no direct effect on political trust. Third, threat perceptions a) to health and b) from the policy response to the pandemic, have strong and opposite effects on political trust, with threats to health increasing trust, and threats from the government policy response decreasing it. Lastly, these threat perceptions condition the effect of COVID-19 news consumption on political trust: perceptions of threat had the power to both exacerbate and mute the effect of media consumption on government trust during the pandemic. Notably, we show that the expected negative effect of alternative news on political trust only exists for those who did not think COVID-19 posed a threat to their health, while public service news consumption reduced the negative effect produced by government threat perceptions.

Using longitudinal survey data from US respondents linked to their Twitter feeds, we quantify the relationship between exposure to the Russian foreign influence campaign and attitudes and voting behavior in the 2016 US election. We demonstrate, first, that exposure to Russian disinformation accounts was heavily concentrated: only 1% of users accounted for 70% of exposures. Second, exposure was concentrated among users who strongly identified as Republicans. Third, exposure to the Russian influence campaign was eclipsed by content from domestic news media and politicians. Finally, we find no evidence of a meaningful relationship between exposure to the Russian foreign influence campaign and changes in attitudes, polarization, or voting behavior. The results have implications for understanding the limits of election interference campaigns on social media."

To date, there is remarkably little empirical data about how often users ""like,"" comment and share content from news pages on Facebook, how user engagement compares between sources that have a reputation for misinformation and those that do not, and how the political leaning of the source impacts the equation. In this work, we propose a methodology to generate a list of news publishers' official Facebook pages annotated with their partisanship and (mis)information status based on third-party evaluations, and collect engagement data for the 7.5 M posts that 2,551 U.S. news publishers made on their pages during the 2020 U.S. presidential election. We propose three metrics to study engagement (1) across the Facebook news ecosystem, (2) between (mis)information providers and their audiences, and (3) with individual pieces of content from (mis)information providers. Our results show that misinformation news sources receive widespread engagement on Facebook, accounting for 68.1% of all engagement with far-right news providers, followed by 37.7 % on the far left.

From the over one million tweets and four million retweets collected, we identified two well-defined groups, one in favor and another against vaccination. Within the sample, we selected 1500 influencer tweets with the highest impact (>500 retweets) and conducted content analysis. Although the pro-vaccine influencers were more retweeted than anti-vaxxer ones, we observed that anti-vaccine movements were more succesful in framing discussions on Twitter.

The median age was 28 years; 63% (N=998) identified as women, and 36% spoke an Indigenous Mayan language. Twenty-one per cent of participants (N=327) reported watching the intervention content on social media. At baseline, 89% (N=1402) of participants reported having at least one COVID-19 vaccine, compared with 97% (N=1507) in the follow-up.

In this article, we theorize that the relationship between social media use and affective polarization depends on the ways in which social media are used. Based on two-wave panel data collected during a national election campaign, our findings suggest that only active political uses of social media (i.e., sharing, posting, or commenting) foster affective polarization; in contrast, passive uses (i.e., informing oneself) do not. Looking at reciprocal relationships, we found that affective polarization did not significantly predict active or passive political social media use over time.

}","Media Exposure, Political Predispositions, and Conspiracy Theories: Explaining Chinese Beliefs in COVID Origins","This article examines the underpinning mechanisms of the Chinese public's belief in two opposing conspiracy theories on the origins of coronavirus disease 2019. Utilizing survey data from 4,251 Chinese internet users, our study reveals both the universality and distinctiveness of mechanisms involved in conspiracy theory beliefs. The distinctiveness primarily emanates from the political system and its media environment, while universality is mainly attributed to the cognitive style of intuitive thinking. In China's political system, exposure to either domestic or foreign media sources exerts substantial influence on public conspiracy beliefs. Notably, we emphasize the mediating role of political ideologies in domestic media exposure. Exposure to domestic media is more likely to lead conservative individuals to reject the conspiracy asserting COVID-19 originated in a lab in China.

Utilizing survey data from 4,251 Chinese internet users, our study reveals both the universality and distinctiveness of mechanisms involved in conspiracy theory beliefs. The distinctiveness primarily emanates from the political system and its media environment, while universality is mainly attributed to the cognitive style of intuitive thinking. In China's political system, exposure to either domestic or foreign media sources exerts substantial influence on public conspiracy beliefs. Notably, we emphasize the mediating role of political ideologies in domestic media exposure. Exposure to domestic media is more likely to lead conservative individuals to reject the conspiracy asserting COVID-19 originated in a lab in China. Concurrently, nationalism mediates foreign media exposure, reinforcing convictions of U.S.-centered conspiracies.

Yet, it is unclear how and why online activity is related to the mobilization of offline collective action. One proposition is that online polarization (or a relative change in intensity of posting mobilizing content around a salient grievance) can mobilize people offline. The identity-norm nexus and normative alignment models of collective action further argue that to be mobilizing, these posts need to be socially validated. To test these propositions, across two analyses, we used digital traces of online behavior and data science techniques to model people's online and offline behavior around a mass protest. In Study 1a, we used Twitter behavior posted on the day of the protest by attendees or nonattendees (759 users; 7,592 tweets) to train and test a classifier that predicted, with 80% accuracy, who participated in offline collective action. Attendees used their mobile devices to plan logistics and broadcast their presence at the protest. In Study 1b, using the longitudinal Twitter data and metadata of a subset of users from Study 1a (209 users; 277,556 tweets), we found that participation in the protest was not associated with an individual's online polarization over the year prior to the protest, but it was positively associated with the validation ( ""likes "") they received on their relevant posts.

Thus, the reasons driving this development-or its consequences-are not yet adequately understood. This article addresses the role of one specific factor frequently discussed in both academic and popular debate-namely, the role of crosscutting communication among people of different political leanings. It is a longstanding notion that crosscutting communication is crucial to overcoming the prejudice, polarization, and attitudinal biases brought on by streamlined information diets. However, there is empirical evidence to suggest that crosscutting experiences sometimes elevate polarization-especially when individuals also have access to like-minded views and when disagreement is perceived as intense. The study sheds light on the connection by testing hypotheses about the association between crosscutting communication and affective polarization in both offline and online modalities of political communication. The empirical analyses were based on panel data from the E-DEM project covering a random sample of Spanish citizens interviewed up to three times between November 2018 and May 2019-that is, the time running up to the Spanish national election in 2019. The results suggest that individuals who reported engagement in face-to-face discussions with supporters of various parties (crosscutting discussions) during this time reported significantly lower levels of affective polarization compared to engagement in discussions with co-partisans exclusively. Online crosscutting and consensual discussion experiences, however, were linked to comparable levels of anti-out-group sentiment, suggesting that concerns about the impact of online communication being different from offline communication in general-and perhaps more harmful-may be overstated. Descriptive evidence furthermore indicates that most respondents who engaged in political discussions had experiences of discussions with both co-partisans and supporters of opposing parties rather than co-partisans exclusively.

Especially on visual social media, where many different forms, topics and tones circulate, so-called ""news feeds"" offer blends of content that only partially match traditional journalistic conceptualizations. This paper advances current conceptual debates around news(-ness), by going beyond what is culturally accepted and cognitively recognized as news. We make an argument for the importance of capturing young people's affective and tacit understandings of news, by analyzing what feels like news to them on Instagram. These judgments matter because what users understand as news or non-news also affects their assessments of trustworthiness and reliability. Drawing upon a three-wave study (2020-2022) employing in-depth interviews with and walk-throughs of the Instagram feeds of N = 111 Dutch smartphone users (aged 16-25), we find that while young people are strongly aware of societal norms around what news is or should be, these cognitive understandings do not necessarily align with what they experience as news(-like) within their everyday practices. Although some users do employ traditional journalistic conceptualizations of news, others negotiate or challenge such definitions through processes of compartmentalization, homogenization or reconceptualization, to mitigate tensions between what they cognitively recognize versus what they affectively perceive as news.

}",Explainable Deep Learning for False Information Identification: An Argumentation Theory Approach,"In today's world, where online information is proliferating in an unprecedented way, a significant challenge is whether to believe the information we encounter. Ironically, this flood of information provides us with an opportunity to combat false claims by understanding their nature. That is, with the help of machine learning, it is now possible to effectively capture the characteristics of false information by analyzing massive amounts of false claims published online. These methods, however, have neglected the nature of human argumentation, delegating the process of making inferences of the truth to the black box of neural networks. This has created several challenges (namely latent text representations containing entangled syntactic and semantic information, an irrelevant part of text being considered when abstracting text as a latent vector, and counterintuitive model explanation). To resolve these issues, based on Toulmin's model of argumentation, we propose a computational framework that helps machine learning for false information identification (FII) understand the connection between a claim (whose veracity needs to be verified) and evidence (which contains information to support or refute the claim). Specifically, we first build a word network of a claim and evidence reflecting their syntaxes and convert it into a signed word network using their semantics. The structural balance of this word network is then calculated as a proxy metric to determine the consistency between a claim and evidence. The consistency level is fed into machine learning as input, providing information for verifying claim veracity and explaining the model's decision making.

Twitter users were more inclined to accept vaccines when they trusted vaccine safety and effectiveness, but vaccine hesitancy increased due to conspiracy theories and misinformation. The association of topics with these theoretical frameworks reveals the availability and diversity of Twitter data that can predict behavioral change toward vaccines. It allows the preparation of timely and effective interventions for vaccination programs compared to traditional methods."

Using a convenient sample of approximately 300 young adults, the current study examines the link between social media exposure and police occupational commitment after controlling for the key audience characteristics. Findings reveal that the longer time that individuals spend on social media, the less likely they would attach to the police occupation.

Most data-driven infodemiology research is designed to characterise content rather than measure associations between information exposure and health behaviours. Studies also tend to be limited to specific social media platforms, are unable to capture the breadth of individual information exposure that occur online and offline, and cannot measure differences in trust by information source or content. Studies are also designed very differently, limiting synthesis of results.ResultsWe demonstrate a way to address these requirements via a web-based study platform that includes an app that participants use to record topic-specific information exposure, a browser plugin for tracking access to relevant webpages, questionnaires that can be delivered at any time during a study, and app-based incentives for participation such as visual analytics to compare trust levels with other participants.

For this, the present study collected data from 352 social media users in South Korea through the survey for which the professional survey company gave electronic gift cards to respondents to increase the response rate and reduce the non-response bias. And, it used hierarchical multiple regression analyses. First, the results show that the more socialization, pass-time, or information-seeking gratification participants perceive online, the more favorable fake news sharing they have. Conversely, entertainment was not significantly associated with fake news sharing in this study. Second, the positive relationship between socialization gratification support and fake news sharing is stronger for participants with high rather than low online trust.

}",Social Media News Use and COVID-19 Misinformation Engagement: Survey Study,"Background: Social media is widely used as a source of news and information regarding COVID-19. However, the abundance of misinformation on social media platforms has raised concerns regarding the spreading infodemic. Accordingly, many have questioned the utility and impact of social media news use on users' engagement with (mis)information. Objective: This study offers a conceptual framework for how social media news use influences COVID-19 misinformation engagement. More specifically, we examined how news consumption on social media leads to COVID-19 misinformation sharing by inducing belief in such misinformation. We further explored if the effects of social media news use on COVID-19 misinformation engagement depend on individual differences in cognition and personality traits. Methods: We used data from an online survey panel administered by a survey agency (Qualtrics) in Singapore. The survey was conducted in March 2022, and 500 respondents answered the survey. All participants were older than 21 years and provided consent before taking part in the study. We used linear regression, mediation, and moderated mediation analyses to explore the proposed relationships between social media news use, cognitive ability, personality traits, and COVID-19 misinformation belief and sharing intentions. Results: The results suggested that those who frequently used social media for news consumption were more likely to believe COVID-19 misinformation and share it on social media. Further probing the mechanism suggested that social media news use translated into sharing intent via the perceived accuracy of misinformation. Simply put, social media news users shared COVID-19 misinformation because they believed it to be accurate. We also found that those with high levels of extraversion than those with low levels were more likely to perceive the misinformation to be accurate and share it. Those with high levels of neuroticism and openness than those with low levels were also likely to perceive the misinformation to be accurate. Finally, it was observed that personality traits did not significantly influence misinformation sharing at higher levels of cognitive ability, but low cognitive users largely drove misinformation sharing across personality traits. Conclusions: The reliance on social media platforms for news consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified, with dire consequences for misinformation sharing.

We collect 13,723,654 posts from 14,532 pages and 11,454 public groups from August through October 2020, posts that together account for nearly all engagement of U.S. public political content on Facebook. We use perceptual hashing to identify duplicate images and computer vision to identify political figures. Twenty-three percent of sampled political images (N = 1,000) contained misinformation, as did 20% of sampled images (N = 1,000) containing political figures.

Nonetheless, it is crucial to supplement these approaches with interpretative methods to validate assumptions based on timelines. By employing a triangulation of methods encompassing descriptive analysis, such as timelines, word and retweet frequency analysis, and manual interpretation and labeling of representative samples, we uncover that discussions about Jews on Twitter during a turbulent 5-week period were predominantly centered around antisemitism. However, these discussions took various forms, including expressing concerns about the increase in antisemitism, denouncing antisemitism, remembering the Holocaust, refuting accusations of antisemitism, and even promoting antisemitic ideologies.

This increase can be attributed to three triggering events that might have been overlooked when drawing conclusions solely from a simplistic timeline analysis of the term ""Jews"" or targeted slurs. In conclusion, we advocate for a mixed-methods approach where quantitative computational tools are complemented by qualitative discourse analysis.

In October 2019, in Ecuador and Chile, participation in these protests was characterized by street protests and broad political participation in social networks and alternative media, which were followed or interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These facts have been deeply researched, addressing causal and structural factors of the phenomenon, the alternatives of political participation, and the role of emotions as determinants of action in these contexts. The objective of this study is to explore offline and online political participation (Facebook) after the social outbreak of 2019 in both countries, based on political interest, and how emotions intervene, especially negative ones, in a context of high demobilization. MethodsA descriptive, correlational ex post facto and cross-sectional methodology was used, with the participation of 367 people, 210 from Ecuador (57.2%) and 157 from Chile (42.8%), aged between 17 and 48 years (M = 22.13, SD = 3.73).

We examine the argumentative repertoire around vaccines on the forum, and whether it assimilated to or challenged common arguments for and against vaccines, or extended it in ways unique to the racist WN agenda. Methods: We use a mixed-methods approach, combining unsupervised machine learning of 8892 posts including the term “vaccin*�? published on Stormfront between 2001 and 2017. We supplemented the computational analysis with a manual coding of randomly sampled 500 posts, evaluating the prevalence of pro- and anti-vaccine sentiment, previously identified pro- and anti-vaccine arguments, and WN-specific arguments. Results: Discourse was dynamic, increasing around specific events, such as outbreaks and following legal debates about vaccine mandates. We identified four themes: conspiracies, science, race and white innovation. The prominence of themes over time was relatively stable.

Our aim is to design a data processing pipeline featuring a high-accuracy Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based political camp classifier, a botnet detection algorithm, and a robust measure of botnet effects. Our experiments reveal that while the pro-Russian botnet contributes significantly to network polarization, the pro-Ukrainian botnet contributes with moderating effects. To understand the factors leading to these different effects, we analyze the interactions between the botnets and the users, distinguishing between barrier-crossing users, who navigate across different political camps, and barrier-bound users, who remain within their own camps.

This primarily stems from the high costs of gathering evidence, incomplete coverage of evidence collection, and the inability to identify and halt infringement activities in a timely manner during the process of traditional digital copyright protection. Therefore, this study designs and implements a blockchain-based digital recipe copyright protection scheme to address the issues of insufficient legal evidence and cumbersome processes in traditional digital copyright protection.

Data from a survey of 997 U.S. adults indicate that media exposure to opioids and relevant topics significantly influenced stigma and support for punitive and public health-oriented policies, even after direct and indirect experiences with opioid misuse were controlled for. However, differences emerged in terms of what led people to endorse each type of policy intervention. When people attributed opioid misuse to individual-oriented causes after media exposure, they were more likely to support punitive policies. When people recognized pharmaceutical-oriented causes, they tended to support public health-related policies.In addition to causal attributions, emotions (fear, anger, and sympathy) served as mediators with different effects on stigma and policy support. Although exposure to opioid-related stories positively influenced all three emotions, media influence was most likely to elicit sympathy, which was negatively associated with social stigma.

In times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, it is valuable to examine the interrelationships among psychological, sociocultural, and informational factors. This can provide valuable insights for policymakers in developing effective communication strategies. Drawing an analogy between the Media dependency theory (MDT) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model, this study unravels the factors underpinning the COVID-19 vaccine uptake intention among Pakistanis. The study utilized a cross-sectional research design and employed a survey method to gather data from a sample of 993 participants. The findings obtained from the PLS-SEM analysis confirmed that individuals relied on both traditional and social media to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings show that individuals rely more on the informational content disseminated through conventional media channels. The findings also suggest that individuals from Asian countries, such as Pakistan, tend to be more inclined toward collectivism.

The 22-item updated Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance (uIRMA) scale is a widely used, reliable measure for assessing this construct; however, it has primarily been validated within samples of U.S. college students. To assess the factor structure and reliability of this measure for community samples of adult women, we analyzed uIRMA data from 356 U.S. women (age 25-35) collected via CloudResearch's MTurk toolkit. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated high internal reliability for the overall scale (alpha = .92) and supported a five-factor structure (subscales: She Asked For It, He Didn't Mean To, He Didn't Mean To [Intoxication], It Wasn't Really Rape, She Lied) with good model fit.

This study explores the role of political brand hate and individual moral consciousness in influencing electorates' intention to share political deepfake content.Design/methodology/approachThe study creates and uses a fictional deepfake video to test the proposed model. Data are collected from N = 310 respondents in India and tested using partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) with SmartPLS v3.FindingsThe findings support that ideological incompatibility with the political party leads to political brand hate, positively affecting the electorates' intention to share political deepfake videos. This effect is partially mediated by users' reduced intention to verify political deepfake videos. In addition, it is observed that individual moral consciousness positively moderates the effect of political brand hate on the intention to share political deepfake videos. Intention to share political deepfake videos thus becomes a motive to seek revenge on the hated party, an expression of an individual's ideological hate and a means to preserve one's moral self-concept and strengthen their ideologies and moral beliefs.Originality/valueThe study expands the growing discussion about disseminating political deepfake videos using the theoretical lens of the negative consumer-brand relationship. It validates the effect of political brand hate on irrational behavior that is intended to cause harm to the hated party. Further, it provides a novel perspective that individual moral consciousness may fuel the haters' desire to engage in anti-branding behavior. Political ideological incompatibility reflects ethical reasons for brand hate. Therefore, hate among individuals with high moral consciousness serves to preserve their moral self."
